# Khabar - Personalized News Application

Traditional news consumption needs more personalization and relevance to users' locations, leading to information overload and disengagement. With abundant digital news sources, finding relevant content aligned with users' interests is challenging. This disconnect between users and news content hinders effective engagement with current events, potentially leading to uninformed decision-making and disconnection from societal issues. Additionally, the lack of localized news updates may result in users missing out on important community events and developments. Therefore, all this highlights the need for a solution that delivers personalized news content tailored to users' geographical locations and interests, fostering a more informed and engaged citizenry.
